# Silex Captcha Provider (Silex 2)

**IMPORTANT&nbsp;:** this is a work in progress, please donâ€™t use this package
for now.

This provider will give you access to a set of tools for easily working with
captcha validation in forms, namely&nbsp;:

* a `captcha` service for generating captchas
* a route/controller couple which serves captcha images
* a pre-configured `CaptchaType` form type
* a Twig template for rendering within an HTML form

Everything will be automatically plugged in when you register the provider.

## Requirements

* [PHP](https://secure.php.net/) 5.6+
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) 2
